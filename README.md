loop-dots
=========

A looping set of scripts to allow many
[`...`](http://github.com/ingydotnet/....git) repos to play along nicely.

This should go high up in the `~/.../conf`, so that its dot-files take
precedence over the other repos (but, don't worry - the others will still get
sourced. In fact, that's the whole point of loop-dots!)

By convention, repos that are designed to be used after loop-dots are all
named `*-dots`.

This is shamelessly ripped off from [`rjbs/loop-dots`](https://github.com/rjbs/loop-dots).
